# dependency-track

This is an alternative version or the official chart (https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts) to support our internal cluster (based on openshift).

We plan to upstream any valuable change to the existing official helm-chart but currently lack time and resources.

Feel free to contact us if you want to help.
